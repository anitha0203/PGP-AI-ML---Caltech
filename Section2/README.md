#  PGC AIML Foundations: Mathematics & Statistics Essentials🚀📊

##  Statistics📊🎉
Statistics is a fundamental tool of data scientists, who are expected to gather and analyze large amounts of structured and unstructured data and report on their findings.

or

Statistics is the science concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting empirical data.

#### Difference between Population and Sample🌐👥
A population refers to the entire set of individuals, objects, or measurements that share a common characteristic. A sample, on the other hand, is a subset of the population.

#### Forecasting in Statistics🔮📈
Forecasting is like predicting the future based on past and present data.

#### Types of Statistics📊📈

### 1. Descriptive Statistics:📊

**Definition:** Descriptive statistics involve methods for summarizing and presenting data in a meaningful way. It helps in describing the main features of a dataset.

**Examples:**
- Measurement of central tendency (mean, median, mode):
- Measures of Dispersion: Range, Variance, Standard Deviation.
- Percentiles and Quartiles: Dividing data into 100 or 4 equal parts.
### 2. Inferential Statistics:📈📉

**Definition:** Inferential statistics involve making inferences or predictions about a population based on a sample of data taken from that population. It helps in generalizing findings beyond the observed data.

**Examples:**

- Hypothesis Testing: Making educated guesses about a population parameter based on a sample.
- Confidence Intervals: Estimating the range within which a population parameter is likely to fall.
- Regression Analysis: Examining the relationship between variables to make predictions.


###  3. Probability🎲
Probability is a number between 0 and 1 that represents the likelihood of an event happening. A probability of 0 means the event is impossible, and a probability of 1 means the event is certain.


### [Different types of data](https://derangedphysiology.com/main/cicm-primary-exam/required-reading/research-methods-and-statistics/Chapter%203.0.1/different-types-data#:~:text=Numerical%20)

🏷️
**Nominal Data:**
Nominal data represents categories or labels without any specific order. It is qualitative data with no inherent numerical significance.

*Example:* Colors (e.g., red, blue, green), types of animals, gender.

🥇
**Ordinal Data:**
Ordinal data has categories with a meaningful order or ranking, but the intervals between the categories are not uniform or meaningful.

*Example:* Educational levels (e.g., elementary, high school, college), customer satisfaction ratings (e.g., poor, satisfactory, excellent).

🔢
**Discrete Data:**
Discrete data consists of separate, distinct values that are countable and often represent items that can be counted using whole numbers.

*Example:* The number of students in a class, the count of cars in a parking lot.

📏
**Continuous Data:**
Continuous data can take any value within a range and includes an infinite number of possible values. It is measured, not counted.

*Example:* Height, weight, temperature, income.
