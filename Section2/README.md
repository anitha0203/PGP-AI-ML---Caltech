#  PGC AIML Foundations: Mathematics & Statistics Essentials🚀📊

## Mathematics🧮

Mathematics is a field of study that deals with the properties and relationships of numbers, quantities, shapes, and patterns. It involves using logical reasoning to understand, analyze, and solve problems.


### [Different types of data](https://derangedphysiology.com/main/cicm-primary-exam/required-reading/research-methods-and-statistics/Chapter%203.0.1/different-types-data#:~:text=Numerical%20)

### Categorical Data types🏷️
Categorical data represents categories or labels without any specific order. It is qualitative data with no inherent numerical significance.

**Nominal Data:**
Nominal data represents categories or labels without any specific order. It is qualitative data with no inherent numerical significance.

*Example:* Colors (e.g., red, blue, green), types of animals, gender.

**Ordinal Data:**
Ordinal data has categories with a meaningful order or ranking, but the intervals between the categories are not uniform or meaningful.

*Example:* Educational levels (e.g., elementary, high school, college), customer satisfaction ratings (e.g., poor, satisfactory, excellent).

### Numerical Data types🔢
Numerical data includes values that are numeric and represent measurable quantities. It can be further categorized into discrete and continuous data.

**Discrete Data:**
Discrete data consists of separate, distinct values that are countable and often represent items that can be counted using whole numbers.

*Example:* The number of students in a class, the count of cars in a parking lot.

**Continuous Data:**
Continuous data can take any value within a range and includes an infinite number of possible values. It is measured, not counted.

*Example:* Height, weight, temperature, income.

#### Difference between Population and Sample🌐👥
A population refers to the entire set of individuals, objects, or measurements that share a common characteristic. A sample, on the other hand, is a subset of the population.

#### Forecasting in Statistics🔮📈
Forecasting is like predicting the future based on past and present data.

#### Types of Statistics📊📈

### 1. Descriptive Statistics:📊

**Definition:** Descriptive statistics involve methods for summarizing and presenting data in a meaningful way. It helps in describing the main features of a dataset.

**Examples:**
- Measurement of central tendency (mean, median, mode):
- Measures of Dispersion: Range, Variance, Standard Deviation.
- Percentiles and Quartiles: Dividing data into 100 or 4 equal parts.
### 2. Inferential Statistics:📈📉

**Definition:** Inferential statistics involve making inferences or predictions about a population based on a sample of data taken from that population. It helps in generalizing findings beyond the observed data.

**Examples:**

- Hypothesis Testing: Making educated guesses about a population parameter based on a sample.
- Confidence Intervals: Estimating the range within which a population parameter is likely to fall.
- Regression Analysis: Examining the relationship between variables to make predictions.


###  3. Probability🎲
Probability is a number between 0 and 1 that represents the likelihood of an event happening. A probability of 0 means the event is impossible, and a probability of 1 means the event is certain.



##  Statistics📊🎉
Statistics is a fundamental tool of data scientists, who are expected to gather and analyze large amounts of structured and unstructured data and report on their findings.

Statistics is the science concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting empirical data.

## [Mean, Median And Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvftKv9uctk)

-   **Mean** is average of a given set of data
-   The **median** is the middle value in a dataset when it is ordered from smallest to largest. If there is an odd number of data points, the median is the middle value. If there is an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values.
-   The **mode** is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset.

## [Variance and Standard Devation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E7NU-uWalY)

**Variance** is the sum of squares of differences between all numbers and means. 
Deviation for above example. First, calculate the deviations of each data point from the mean, and square the result of each:

variance = (9 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 16) / 8 = 4.

Where μ is Mean, N is the total number of elements or frequency of distribution. 

  
**Standard Deviation** is square root of variance. It is a measure of the extent to which data varies from the mean. 

Standard Deviation (for above data) = &#8730;4 = 2 


##  Probability

Conditional probability is a fundamental concept in probability theory that deals with the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred.

### Types of Probability
